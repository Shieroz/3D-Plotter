A 3D Plotter that can handle millions of points!

This is a demo for the CFD visualization feature in Corfix, a VR interface for surgery planning. This program will take a CSV file containing Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
Simulation results and display it neatly as a 3D pointcloud. The Wall Shear Stress (WSS) value can also be modified by the user as assistance in analytics.
